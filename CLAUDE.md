# Sea — notes for agents

Sea is a fast matrix/numerical language, an alternative to MATLAB, with modern C/Rust-like syntax
(not MATLAB-compatible). Child project of Baysick (https://github.com/frgmt0/Baysick), a Dartmouth
BASIC (1964) rebuild hand-written in assembly, with targets `arm64-macos` (native) and
`x86_64-linux` (cross-compiled, tested on Linux), its own IR and plug-in backends.

## Status
**Phase 0** (agreement and contracts, 2026-10-20) and **phase 1** (scalar core, arm64; complete
at sea commit e6e9873) of DESIGN.md §8 are done. The six passes (`seaparse` `seacheck` `seaexpand`
`sealower` `seaopt` `seagen_a64`), the driver, the arm64 runtime and the tools are written; the
W5 LCG acceptance test passes; the size estimate of DESIGN.md §2.7 is recalibrated from the real
passes. Decisions taken during phase 1 are recorded in DESIGN.md §0 ("Decided in phase 1").
**Phase 2** (the x86_64 target: `seagen_x64`, the x86_64 runtime, `cross*.sh`; DESIGN.md §4.7.1,
§4.9.1, §6.6.1) is complete at sea commit a87ca78: `make cross` passes every case on the Linux
host. Decision 7 (the user's MATLAB rerun) is done: the MATLAB baseline is committed at sea
commit c1736f7. **Phase 3** (elementary functions: Sea's own scalar `log exp sin cos pow hypot`
on both targets (Decision 6), and the compile-time `pow`; DESIGN.md §4.10) is complete at sea commit 98e1e14: the
`math/` tests pass on both targets (≤ 1 ulp against the high-precision references, identical bits
on both targets). **Phase 4** of DESIGN.md §8
(**arrays and structs**) is complete: sub-phases 4a (pass 2a split into `seaname` and `seacheck`,
sea commit 263ee1f), 4b (the phase-4 specification, 2dfe535), 4c (heap runtime, a59ca07) and 4d
(dynamic arrays core, W4 scalar SOR accepted by `make test-accept`) are done. The size gate after
4d (DESIGN.md §2.7) projected `sealower` to 9 665 lines, so sub-phase 4e-0 split pass 3a into
`sealoop` (`sea.hir` → `sea.hirl`, the array constructs made explicit as scalar loops) and
`sealower` (`sea.hirl` → `sea.lir1`, unchanged). **4e-0 is done** (built and tested, no change of
behaviour; Decisions 26–30; measured: `sealoop` 2 323 lines with 7 free array letters, `sealower`
5 164 lines with 4 free, DESIGN.md §2.7); **4e (array expressions) is done** (Decisions 31–37: the `sealoop` rewrites L5–L12 with the
`sea.hirl` refinements R1–R11, rule 27 for fixed-size numeric arrays, DESIGN.md §3.5.9, §3.6.6, §8;
measured: `sealoop` 4 129 lines, `sealower` 5 971, DESIGN.md §2.7); **4f (reductions, sorting,
searching, library options) is done** (Decisions 38–43: the `sealoop` rewrites L13–L14 with the
`sea.hirl` refinements R12–R16 and the `wop` word `and`, result types on fixed-size arguments,
`rt_sort.s` with `f64`, `i64` and `str` on both targets, error 115 for a positional argument after a
named one; DESIGN.md §0, §3.5.9, §4.8, §8). The size gate after 4f (Decision 35) passed with no
split: `sealoop` 4 400 built lines (projected v1 7 950, 4 free array letters), `sealower` 6 087
(7 987, 4 free), `seacheck` 5 830 (6 780, 14 free), DESIGN.md §2.7. **4g** (strings, structs,
records, `match`, `error`, `args`) **is done** (Decisions 44–48 and the lead decisions L-a … L-n:
the `sea.hirl` refinements R17–R25 with no new record kind, the `sealoop` rewrites L15 projection, L16
`match` and L17 reference, aggregate and field-path stores, element-wise `str` operators, scalar-only
`str()`/`lower()`, records as anonymous struct types, the shared module `passes/lib/layout.bas`; no
contract file changes; DESIGN.md §0, §2.6.2, §2.7, §3.5.9, §6.2, §8), built in two sub-steps
(Decision 47). **4g-1** (strings, `match`, `error`, `args`, `str` elements, `sort_str`; lead
decision L-n: an L17 `str` element store into a `ref` parameter root reads P afresh after the cow
until 4g-2). The size gate after 4g-1 passed with no relief: `sealower` 6 349 built lines (projected
after 4g-2 P = 6 956, 44 under 7 000; v1 8 056; 4 free array letters), `sealoop` 4 659 (5 114; 8 214;
4 free), `seacheck` 5 944 (6 081; 14 free), DESIGN.md §2.7. **4g-2** (structs, records, projection,
fixed-size `str` and struct arrays, the module `layout` of 123 lines, `manualD_part1`) measured
`sealower` 6 994 built lines (v1 8 394 with 4h counted, lead decision L-o; 3 free array letters), `sealoop` 5 433 (8 533, 3 free),
`seacheck` 6 424 (14 free), `seaname` 5 262 (DESIGN.md §2.7, "Measured after 4g-2"): `sealower` is
6 lines under its 7 000-line cap. The relief is agreed (Decisions 49–52, lead decisions L-o–L-r, DESIGN.md §0, §2.7, §8, §9): a
behaviour-neutral compaction of `sealower` (C1–C6, about 600 lines; reserves: `sea.hirl` validation
into `seaval`, rule 36's composites into `sealoop`, a middle HIR→HIR pass), the 7 000-line cap kept
through 4h, gates after 4h-0, 4h, phase 6 and phase 8. **4h-0 is done**: `sealower` 6 304 built
lines (690 saved; the multi-line `DEF` functions `FNQ`, `FNE`, `FNR$`; 3 free array letters),
proved neutral by byte-identical `sea.lir1`, and the gate after 4h-0 passed (6 604 ≤ 7 000 with
4h, v1 7 704, stress 8 254; reserve V not needed), DESIGN.md §2.7 "Measured after 4h-0". **4h is
done** (Decisions 53–57, lead decisions L-s–L-ab: prelude inlining by `sealoop`'s rewrite L18 into
the `sea.hirl` records `iblk`/`iret` (`passes.txt` HL 88–89), lowered by `sealower` (R26–R30);
`std.sea`'s `linspace`, `meshgrid`, `setdiff`, `bincount`; W5 accepted). The gate after 4h passed:
`sealower` 6 473 built lines (v1 7 573, stress 8 123; free letters `C S X`), `sealoop` 5 829 (v1
8 429; `B X Y`), `seacheck` 6 426 (14 free), `seaname` 5 281 (DESIGN.md §2.7 "Measured after 4h").
**Phase 4 is complete.** **Phase 5** (scalar code quality) is specified and agreed (5a; Decisions
58–73, lead decisions L-ac–L-at (L-an–L-at after a review of the text): `seaopt`'s T1–T10 of
DESIGN.md §5.8, the shared allocator `passes/lib/ralloc.bas` of §4.9.2, the shape tests and
micro-benchmarks of §6.2, §5.9). **5b** (allocator and code selection, both targets) and **5c-1**
(`seaopt`'s T1–T4, T10) **are done**: `make test` and `make cross` (555) pass; `seaopt` 5 316 built
lines, `seagen_a64` 4 958, `seagen_x64` 5 294 (DESIGN.md §2.7 "Measured after 5b and 5c-1", with the
gate arithmetic that showed `seaopt` could not take T5–T9). The user then decided Decision 74 (the
loop transformations T5–T9 move to a new pass 3c `sealopt`, `sea.lir2` → `sea.lir`, sharing
`seaopt`'s reader, validator, writer and T10 through the shared main-program part `passes/lib/lirrw.bas`, L-bi; phase 7's
vectorizer goes there too, revised by Decision 78) and Decision 75 (the allocator extends an interval over a loop only when
it may be live at the loop's top), lead decisions L-bc–L-bf; after their review, L-bg–L-bk (liveness tested after a loop as
inside it, coverage by effective part, `lirrw` as a main-program part, golden lists, sizes) and
L-bl–L-bp (fresh registers for each copy of a versioned or unswitched loop, T9 placing copy-only
values back into each copy's arm, T10 deleting dead selections, §5.2's register counts re-derived,
`lirrw`'s reserved names: 2 free array letters in `seaopt` and `sealopt`) and L-bq (T4's
self-reading selection only where its register is written on every path or dead). **5c-2 is done** (`sealopt` 5 411 built
lines, `seaopt` 5 491; `make test` and `make cross` (596) pass; lead decisions L-br–L-bv, DESIGN.md
§2.7 "Measured after 5c-2"). **5d is done** (Decisions 76–77, the `seagen_x64` `imulh` fix): the
W5 and W4 loops meet DESIGN.md §5.2's shapes on both targets (20/23 and 24/27 instructions, no
frame access); micro-benchmarks (§5.9): `sor` ≈ C on both targets, `lcg` 1.19× (M2 Pro) and 1.35×
(i7-4790) C. **Phase 5 is complete** (shapes met on both targets, `sor` ≈ C, `lcg` 1.19/1.35× C;
Decisions 76–78): the gate after phase 5 passed with Decision 78 (phase 7's scalar replacement
and vectorization get their own pass 3d after `sealopt`, sharing `lirrw`, name and files at phase
7's spec; `sealopt` takes fixes only, its letter condition waived; DESIGN.md §2.7 "Measured after
5d"). **Phase 6** (functions and output) **is specified** (6a, agreed 2026-10-26: Decisions 80–93,
lead decisions L-bw–L-cx; DESIGN.md §2.11, §2.7, §6.2, §6.3, §8): named and default arguments,
§8.6 inlining (`sealoop` L20, `sealower` R31/R32), elemental functions (L19), `format`, `print`,
`make_dir`, `f64 %`, `write_json` (rule 39, runtime entries 23–38), the W1 and W5 ports without
figures; `seacheck` gated as `sealower` is (Decision 82). **6b is done** (2026-10-28: named and
default arguments, §8.6 inlining, `f64` `%`, `format`, `print`, `make_dir`, runtime entries 23–38;
lead decisions L-cy–L-dh; `make test` and `make cross` (700) pass; `seacheck` 6 798 built lines,
`sealoop` 5 936, `sealower` 6 637, `seaname` 5 424, DESIGN.md §2.7 "Measured after 6b"). **6c is
done** (2026-10-28: elemental functions, `ind2sub` with an array `r`; lead decisions L-di–L-dq;
`make test` and `make cross` (742) pass; `seacheck` 6 863 built lines, `sealoop` 6 438, `seaexpand` 4 359, `seaname` 5 555, DESIGN.md §2.7
"Measured after 6c"; the measurement after 6c calls for no relief, so 6b-0 is not run, Decision 87).
**6d is done** (2026-10-28: `write_json`; lead decisions L-dr–L-ec; `make test` and `make cross`
(776) pass; `seacheck` 6 919 built lines, `seaexpand` 4 796, `sealoop` 6 512, `sealower` 6 729,
DESIGN.md §2.7 "Measured after 6d"). **6e is done** (2026-10-29: the ports `ports/w1_shaft_design.sea`
and `ports/w5_tolerance_mc.sea` without figures, their token maps, `tests/accept.sh`, the cross case
kind `ports`; lead decisions L-ed–L-eg; `tests/accept.sh` passes both, every JSON key and both reports;
`make test` and `make cross` (778) pass, the ports byte-identical on the host but for the `Compute
time` line; DESIGN.md §6.3 "Measured at 6e"). The gate after phase 6 passes every program with no
relief (`sealoop` 6 512 built lines, 8 762 at the stress line with phase 7's fusion, 3 free letters:
fusion stays in `sealoop`; DESIGN.md §2.7 "Measured at the gate after phase 6"). **Phase 6 is
complete.** **Phase 7** (fusion and SIMD, DESIGN.md §8 row 7) **is specified** (7a, agreed
2026-10-29 after two independent reviews: Decisions 94–113, each option (a), lead decisions
L-eh–L-fl; DESIGN.md §2.12, §2.7, §6.2, §6.3, §6.6.1, §8): fusion F1–F5 in a new pass-3a program
`seafuse` (`sea.hir` → `sea.hirf`, ahead of `sealoop`, also doing L19), pass 3d `seavec`
(`sea.lir3` → `sea.lir`: T11 unrolling, T12 scalar replacement, T13 if-conversion and
vectorization), NEON/SSE2/AVX2 code in pass 4, runtime entries 39–50 (vector elementary
functions), the W4 port, a run-time allocation count (`SEA_HEAP_CHECK=count`), and LANGUAGE.md
§9.2's out-of-memory sentence (added by WP-CONTRACT). **7b is done** (2026-10-29: the
contract changes, the new programs `seafuse` and `seavec`, `sealopt` writing `sea.lir3`, L19
rewritten in `seafuse`, `sealoop` reading `sea.hirf`; neutral by Decision 109 over the whole corpus;
lead decisions L-fm–L-fu; `seafuse` 3 164 built lines with 5 free letters, `sealoop` 6 396;

elementary functions, entries 39–50, `rt_vmath.s` per runtime; DESIGN.md §2.12.8). **7c is done**
(2026-10-30: fusion F1–F5 in `seafuse`, with buffer reuse, in-place selection stores, `tbind`
groups, fused masked and `.flat` reductions and folded concatenation parts in stacks and mixed
rows; the user's D1–D3 and the concatenation decision, lead decisions L-fv–L-gj, DESIGN.md
§2.12.3, §2.12.4 "Readings fixed by 7c"; `make test` and `make cross` (876) pass; two independent
reviews with differential fuzzing against the pre-7c compiler, every defect fixed; the measurement
after 7c passes with no relief: `seafuse` 6 427 built lines with 5 free letters, `sealoop` 6 431
with 3, DESIGN.md §2.7 "Measured after 7c"). **7e is done**
(2026-10-31: `seavec` with T11 unrolling, T12 scalar replacement and T13 if-conversion and
vectorization, vector code in `seagen_a64` (NEON) and `seagen_x64` (SSE2, AVX2), the vector classes
of `lirrw` and `ralloc`, `tools/lirchk` validating every `sea.lir` (Decision 116), both x86_64
variants in the cross run; Decisions 115–117 decided by the user, lead decisions L-gk–L-hp, DESIGN.md

lines, `seagen_a64` 5 254, `seagen_x64` 6 103, all inside the gate, DESIGN.md §2.7 "Measured after
7e"). **7f is done**
(2026-11-01: the W4 port `ports/w4_heat_plate.sea` and its token map, accepted by `tests/accept.sh`;
the allocation count `SEA_HEAP_CHECK=count` in both runtimes; `tests/fusion.sh` (W1 0 and W4 6
allocations per iteration) and the cross case kind `fusion`; the `vector` shape lines with op lists
(Decision 119); T9 restricted to `loop` blocks (Decision 118); the fix of `sealoop`'s and
`seafuse`'s marker reading inside string payloads; Decisions 118–119 decided by the user, lead
decisions L-hq–L-ib, DESIGN.md §2.12.10, §4.5, §6.3, §6.6.1; `make test` passes (stage 1 237,
shape 8, fusion 2, programs 2 192, accept 2 + 3) and `make cross` passes 954 cases (default 826,

`sealopt` 5 548, and the gate after phase 7 passes every program with no relief, DESIGN.md §2.7
"Measured at the gate after phase 7"). **7g is done**
(2026-11-01: the W7 port `ports/w7_drivetrain.sea` and its token map, port-only by Decision 120 (the
user), no pass, runtime, prelude, include or golden change; `tests/accept.sh` passes W1, W4, W5 and
W7; lead decisions L-ic–L-ii, DESIGN.md §6.3 "Measured at 7g"; `make test` passes (accept 2 + 4) and
`make cross` passes 955 cases (default 827, `sse2` 827, once-only 128, total 1 782); W7 compiles in
17.4–20.8 s and computes in 0.134–0.135 s). **Phase 7 is complete.** **Phase 8** (linear algebra,
DESIGN.md §8 row 8) **is specified** (8a, agreed 2026-11-01 after one independent review: Decisions
121–129, each option (a), lead decisions L-ij–L-jf; DESIGN.md §2.13, §8 rows 8a–8d, §9): `@`

(Decision 79).

## Read first
- `docs/LANGUAGE.md` — what Sea programs mean (syntax, types, library, output bytes, errors,
  exit statuses). Normative.
- `docs/DESIGN.md` — goals and their measurement, compiler passes and driver, intermediate file
  formats (§3), runtime ABI, performance model, tests, Baysick growth, milestones, decisions.
  Normative.
- `include/` — the contract files: `passes.txt` (record formats of every intermediate file),
  `limits.inc` (limits), `errors.inc` (error texts and codes, exit statuses) and `rt.inc`
  (runtime layouts and symbols).
- Baysick's `CLAUDE.md` and `docs/` (the toolchain Sea is written in).

## Commands
- Build: `make` (= `make all`: runtime, tools, passes, install). Each pass is built as
  `build/gen/<pass>.bas` (its own files, the modules and `DATA` blocks of its `build.list`,
  `99999 END`; DESIGN.md §2.6.3) and compiled with Baysick (`BAYSICK=<dir>`, default `..`; run
  `make` there first). `build/` is the installation directory (DESIGN.md §2.10).
- Use the compiler: `build/sea build <file.sea> [-o out] [-S] [--emit ast|res|hir1|hir|hirf|hirl|lir1|lir2|lir3|lir]
  [--no-prelude] [--keep-temps]`, `build/sea run <file.sea> [-- args…]` (DESIGN.md §2.2).
- Tests: `make test` runs, after `make all` and `make check-contracts`, every group even if one
  fails: `test-driver` (`tests/driver_check.sh`), `check-data` (`tests/check_data.sh`, the DATA
  generator), `test-lib` (`tests/lib_check.sh`), `test-arith` (`tests/arith_check.sh`, the exact
  arithmetic modules), `test-rt` (`tests/rt/`, runtime tests against `libsea.a`), `test-stage`
  (`tests/stage.sh`, each pass on the previous pass's golden), `test-shape` (`tests/shape.sh`, the
  instruction-count shape of the W5 and W4 hot loops on both targets, DESIGN.md §5.2, §6.2, and the `vector` lines of W1's bisection and W4's selection store, §2.12.10), `test-fusion` (`tests/fusion.sh`, the allocations per iteration of `tests/fusion/` under `SEA_HEAP_CHECK=count`, DESIGN.md §2.12.10), `test-protocol`
  (`tests/protocol.sh`, truncated input, missing `#end`), `test-math`
  (`tests/math/math_check.c`, all six elementary functions bit for bit over `tests/math/*.vec`, and their vector entries against the scalar ones in every lane position and on random inputs),
  `test-la` (`tests/la/la_check.c`, GEMV and VECMAT bit for bit against the pinned orders,
  MATMUL on exact data, and LU, CHOL, the solves, RCOND and EIG (DESIGN.md §2.13.8) under every
  usable variant, with the header `tests/la/gen_consts.sh` writes;
  then `tests/la/la_link.sh`, the link map; DESIGN.md §2.13.8), `test-programs` (`sh tests/run.sh [-v] [pattern]`: programs/, errors/ and the passes/ dumps), `test-accept` (`tests/accept4.sh` then `tests/accept.sh`: the phase-4 acceptance programs and the ports W1, W4 and W5 against `compare.py` and `compare_report.py`; needs `uv`). Each group is also its own target.
- Math: `make test-math` (part of `make test`; `xcrun cc -O1 -ffp-contract=off` against
  `build/libsea.a`); `make math-tables` (developer check, not in `make test`: `timeout 120 uv run
  --with mpmath python tools/math_tables.py --check`); `uv run --with mpmath python tests/vectors/math_vectors.py --check-format` checks the vector files.
- Size: `make lines` (built lines per pass) and `make check-limits` (lines, `FOR`s, string
  bytes, 255-byte lines against Baysick's limits).
- Include check (Mac, Apple `as`): `make check-includes` — first `make check-contracts`, then
  Sea's `include/*.inc` assembled after Baysick's `include/limits.inc` and `include/runtime.inc`
  (`BAYSICK=<dir>`, default `..`), with the assertions of `tests/include_asserts.inc`.
- Contract drift check: `make check-contracts` (`sh tests/check_contracts.sh`, sh + awk, no
  Python) — every `SEA_*` name and value, error and errno record of `include/*.inc` and every
  record format of `include/passes.txt` equals the tables of `docs/DESIGN.md`, both ways.
- Include check on the Linux host (GNU `as`): `make cross-includes` / `sh tests/cross_includes.sh
  [-H host] [-B baysick_dir]` (ssh host, default `desktop`); on Linux itself:
  `make -f Makefile.linux check-includes`.
- x86_64 cross test (DESIGN.md §6.6.1): `make cross` / `sh tests/cross.sh [-v] [-H host]
  [pattern]` (packs on the Mac, one ssh to the host, default `$SEA_CROSS_HOST` else `desktop`);
  `make cross-pack` builds `build/x86_64-linux-bundle` only (every case runs under both x86_64
  variants, default and `sse2`, unless `SEA_KERNELS` is set); on Linux: `sh tests/cross_run.sh
  [-v] BUNDLE_DIR`, `make -f Makefile.linux` (`build-x86_64-linux/libsea.a`), `make -f
  Makefile.linux test-rt` (`tests/rt/x86_64_linux/`), `make -f Makefile.linux test-math`. `make cross` also
  runs the once-only cases `math/math_check`, `la/la_check` and `la/la_link` on the host, and the
  case kind `fusion` (`tests/fusion/`, DESIGN.md §6.6.1) under both variants; `make -f
  Makefile.linux test-la` runs `la_check` there.
- Never set a bogus `SDKROOT`/`DEVELOPER_DIR` on the Mac. Python, if ever needed, via `uv` only.

## Repo layout (DESIGN.md §2.10)
- `passes/<pass>/` the Baysick files and `build.list` of each pass (`seaparse seaname seacheck seaexpand seafuse sealoop sealower seaopt sealopt seavec seagen_a64 seagen_x64`); `passes/lib/` the shared modules
  (`io diag tables lirrw limb f64emu fltlit layout ralloc`), interfaces in `passes/lib/API.md`, `API-arith.md`.
- `tools/` `gendata.bas` (the `DATA` generator), `lirchk.bas` (validator of `sea.lir` with the vector classes, run by `tests/run.sh`, `tests/stage.sh` and `tests/cross_pack.sh`), `seaval.bas` (intermediate-file validator: formats `ast res hir1 hir hirf hirl lir1 lir2 lir3 lir`; `lir2` and `lir3` checked as `lir1` except its two lir1-only label rules, L-bu; `hirf` as `hirl` without `inst emap cdat iblk iret`),
  `passlines.sh`.
- `driver/sea` the driver (POSIX sh); `runtime/arm64_macos/`, `runtime/x86_64_linux/` the
  runtimes (`libsea.a`); `std/std.sea` the prelude.
- `tests/` programs/, errors/, passes/ (dump goldens), rt/, shape/, fusion/, la/, harness/, vectors/ and the
  scripts above; `tests/CORPUS.md` describes the corpus.

## Pass authors
- Baysick limits bite: 10 000 stored lines per built program (own files + modules + `DATA`), 255
  bytes per line, 1000 `FOR`s, 1024 active `CALL`s, 65 536 bytes of string constants outside
  `DATA`; numbers are doubles with no ∞, NaN or −0 (use `limb`/`f64emu`, DESIGN.md §2.8); string
  `=` ignores trailing blanks (compare lengths first, DESIGN.md §2.7).
- Edit the numbered `.bas` files directly and keep the numbering stable (insert between existing
  numbers; each part keeps its line range, DESIGN.md §2.6.3).
- When `make check-limits` shows a pass above 9 000 lines, split it into two programs with an
  intermediate file (DESIGN.md §2.7, §7.3) before adding more.

## Goals, in priority order
1. Raw speed: ahead-of-time compiled to native code; fused element-wise expressions without
   temporaries; hand-written SIMD kernels (NEON on arm64, SSE2/AVX2 on x86_64) chosen by
   CPU-feature dispatch; benchmarked honestly against Apple Accelerate and OpenBLAS (the measuring
   bar, not dependencies).
2. A cleaner language than MATLAB.
3. Free, tiny and portable: standalone native binaries, no giant runtime.

## Repo layout
Sea is its own repo and is a git submodule of the Baysick repo at `sea/`. Baysick is the
authority on the toolchain Sea is built with.

## Invariants
- **Sea is written in Baysick.** If Sea needs a language feature Baysick lacks, add it to Baysick
  (in its repo) rather than working around it in Sea. Prefer following later Dartmouth editions;
  Baysick implements Editions 2-6 plus extensions (v0.6.0).
- **Design before code.** Sea's design is agreed (`docs/LANGUAGE.md`, `docs/DESIGN.md`).
  Changes to it are made in those documents together with the user's agreement, before the code
  that depends on them.
- **Contract rule:** a layout, code, limit, symbol or record format shared between separately
  written parts (passes, runtimes, tests) changes only by editing its contract file
  (`include/*.inc` or `include/passes.txt`) AND the matching doc section in the same change.
  Never hard-code a value that has a name in a contract file.
- **Performance claims need benchmarks** with stated methodology (hardware, sizes, baselines,
  how timed). No claim without a measurement behind it.
- **Follow Baysick's workflow:** spec/contract first (normative docs, shared contract files), then
  implementation, then tests. Expected test outputs come from the spec, never from what the
  implementation prints. See Baysick's `CLAUDE.md` and `docs/`.
- No TODOs, stubs, placeholder or fake data.
- Do not add a license or badges until the user decides on them.
